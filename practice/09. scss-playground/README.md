# ScSS Playground
You can use this project to play around with `ScSS` files and see the result `CSS`. 
The project contains a `scss` folder, inside you will file several scss files.

* The file [`styles.scss`](./scss/styles.scss) is the main file, and it is being compiled continuously. You can modify this file or any other file in this folder
* The project also serves a web page that presents the compiled `CSS`
* To start the project, 
  * run `npm start` (if you are in stackblitz, this happens automatically).
  * navigate to localhost:8080 (again, in stackblitz, this is done for you)
