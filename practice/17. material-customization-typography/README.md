# Try it yourself - Typography
In this exercise we will practice The Typography system of **Angular Material**

> In this example, please use the angular material documentation 
* [System variables](https://material.angular.io/guide/system-variables)
* [Theming Typography](https://material.angular.io/guide/theming#typography)

Then follow these steps: 

## 1. Create global typography rules for html elements
In `styles.scss`
- Create a rule to apply to all paragraph elements
- Set the font to one of the body font system tokens

## 2. Replace the used token in app component
- Find the rule that styles the h1
- Change the font to a large headline

## 3. Customize the theme fonts
- Find the definition of the theme
- Replace the "Roboto" value with a map:
  - set the plain family to `Roboto`
  - set the brand family to `Verdana`
  - set the regular weight to 100
  - set the medium weight to 700
- Notice how it affects your UI
