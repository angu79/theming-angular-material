# Try it yourself - HSL based palletes
In this exercise we will repeat what I did in the **color-spaces** project and create an additional theme using the **HSL** color space.

Please follow these steps: 

## 1. The `style.scss` file
In this file you will find a new class `pal-3` with 9 properties all having the same value. Please use the HSL system to set new values to shades 10-90 so that the palette is consistant with the previous ones.
