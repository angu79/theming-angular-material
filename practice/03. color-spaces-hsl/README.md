# Try it yourself - HSL based palletes
In this exercise we will repeat what I did in the **color-spaces** project and create an additional theme using the **HSL** color space.

Please follow these steps: 

## 1. The `style.scss` file
In this file you will find a new class `pal-3` with 9 properties all having the same value. Please use the HSL system to set new values to shades 10-90 so that the palette is consistant with the previous ones.

>HINT you can change the values of one of the other palettes to HSL by using the color picker, and then use the same saturation and lightness values on the new palette
